# reports

This repo contains miscellaneous reports in quarto (`.qmd`), Rmarkdown
(`.Rmd`) etc. The aim is to use this repo when we need to collaborate on
reports, especially ones that include both text and code.

## Adding reports

Create **separate subfolders** for each project and put all necessary
assets there, such as shared data sets, scripts, quarto documents and
other necessary files. Name subfolders in a descriptive way, preferrably
prefixed with creation year (i.e. “2023_project_name”).

> NB: Do not add indvidual files larger than 50 Mb here, please ([why
> not?](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/)). Larger assets can
> be instead be added as GitHub Releases if required and can then be
> accessed from within a report using
> [`piggyback`](https://github.com/ropensci/piggyback)!

Specific functions attached to projects can be included as well, but
ideally most reusable functions should be placed in other repos
(`bibliotools`, `bibliomatrix` etc) and this repo should mainly contain
text and code related to specific analyses and reports.
